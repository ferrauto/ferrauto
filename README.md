# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ferrauto, Fernando Gonzalez Leon.
## About me ðŸ˜†
-  Iâ€™m a mechatronic engineering student from Colombia **(last year student)**.
-  Iâ€™m currently interested in game development on mobile devices using unity, and in web development (Full Stack) with Node.js, Express.js, React, Bootstrap and css.
-  I really like programming, I know the basics of python, java, javaScript, C#, SQL on ORACLE, arduino, VHDL and matlab.
## Hey @ferrauto! what's your expertise? ðŸ¤¨
   -   I made some really simple image processig and data analitics on python.
   
   -   On java i have made some back end development for web pages and basic desktop apps with netbeans IDE.
   
   -   I'm developing a game with my *college friends* using C# and unity for mobile devices.
   
   -   At university I made a course on relational databases with SQL and ORACLE free version and I have worked a little on MongoDB and mongoose.
   
   -   As a mechachonic student I have worked on arduino, raspberry pi and development cards to move motors, turn on leds, leds/oled/LCD screens, use sensors such as ligh, thermal, gas, infrared, ultrasound, current, etc. ; use PWM, ADC, and conection with other modules that allow the use of wifi/bluetooth and others. Also as an student I learned how to use the basics of VHDL using an embeded system, further more I have worked on image processing and control systems on matlab.
